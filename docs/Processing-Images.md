# Processing Images

If you want automatic generation of thumbnails and other kinds of image manipulation you must add the [php-collective/file-storage-image-processor](https://github.com/php-collective/file-storage-image-processor) package.

```sh
composer require php-collective/file-storage-image-processor
```

Check the documentation of the library on how to work with.
